    - How to draw a concept map
    - the different between the mind map and concept map
    - learn about Self - Learning by watch the TED video,it let me know the point of Self-Learning is Interest-driven and Achievements-driven and Communicate.
2. Problem / Confusing / Difficulties
    - Distinguish between concept and Mind Mapping

    - The importance of self - learning

1. 今天学习了概念图的画法，在学习过程中了解到了概念图和思维导图之间的区别。总结了一些自己的想法，概念图是从一个概念引申出其他的概念，或者其下的子概念，没有固定方向。而思维导图是从一个点，往已知方向去联想，想象，总结得出结论。今天下午尝试画了有关于传统软件开发和敏捷软件开发的概念图，开始还是属于概念图的，但一往下就开始对概念进行总结归纳，给自己限制了方向。 是由于思维倾向于找到一个方向然后再进行探索这样的方式反而导致了限制自己的思维。

1. 今天学习了有关于函数的命名的几点规则，因为平时都会使用到阿里的开发规范，所以命名规范还算比较规范，这里总结一下一些规则

   - Understanding
   - 通常使用V.+n.描述这个函数的操作
   - 使用Business Language
   - Meaningful
   - Directed

   使用规范的命名的好处不止见字知意，还可以让团队其他人更好的阅读你的代码，也利于自己review代码时回想起这函数的作用。所以应该保持好这个良好的习惯。

2. 今天学习了任务分解，把一个需求去分成若干个小点，例如一个功能函数，可以提取出几个小功能函数。然后学习了怎么画Task diagram，去帮助理清写代码的思路，清晰的知道接下来的工作，可视化的task也提高了沟通的效率，及时的获得他人的反馈。

3. "given...when...then"，是一种测试风格，即输入什么参数，执行什么操作后，得到什么结果。将场景分为这三个部分去编写测试代码。

4. 今天学习了jest的环境搭建和编写测试代码，在用npm安装jest依赖的时候发现速度太慢，再更换了淘宝源之后才成功的下载下来。之前使用Spring的时候接用JUnit做单元测试，而今天是第一次接触到jest，感觉这两者这间的使用上給我的感觉很相似，所以我去搜索了一下这两是不是有关系，结果并没有。使用过后觉得这个测试工具还不错，可以对JS函数进行单元测试，及时的发现问题。

# [ITA] Daily Report on 2019/07/10

1. Key learning, skills and experience acquired
   - Today we reviewed Concept Map homework in class to strengthen the impression of the concept map and to improve proficiency, and I find many problems in my homework. Then I make some change.
   - Then to review the code of each other's work in groups, We can see many advantages and disadvantages in their work and learn some good advantage from it.
   - In the afternoon, we learn the JavaScript about the difference between const, var, let, the difference between arrow function and ordinary function and how to use array's function like map(),filter(),reduce().
2. Problem / Confusing / Difficulties
   - Today's homework is too much. 
3. Other Comments / Suggestion
   - The Tasking Graph is real useful!

**1. Key learning, skills and experience acquired**

- we review codes in our team today and then we rebuild it, In this way I found some problem that I didn't notice yesterday, So I think review code is interesting.
- The afternoon we learn java language basic, including keywords like new, class, super, static and concepts like override, overwrite. 

**2. Problem / Confusing / Difficulties**

- During code review, several code smell has been found in my code. I know I have a long way to go in programming.

**3. Other Comments / Suggestion**

- I figured out the java.util.Observer and java.util.Observable !!!

# [ITA] Daily Report on 2019/07/12

**1. Key learning, skills and experience acquired**

- OOP code review: I use observer pattern in my last night homework.
- Java practice: we learn how to use streams(java8 streams API)
- TDD: test drive developmen, its five implementation processes, drawing task maps, writing tests, running tests, writing implementations, running tests; Then repeat these operations.
- the afternoon we do the pair coding practice and is a way improvement of two people's programming ability of a practice.

2.**Problem / Confusing / Difficulties**

- no familiar about streams api because I never use it in my project
- Ican't figure out the difference between aggregation and combination

**3. Other Comments / Suggestion**

- pair coding is good, can learn so much from my partner.

 # [ITA] Notes on Week one(07/08-07/12)
1. Key learning, skills and experience acquired 

- Concept map:
  After a whole week study, I put Concept map at the highest level. Because it is a vital way to learn something new. I don’t know where to start at the beginning, then I do more practice let me gradually master the drawing skills. This process makes me feel a sense of accomplishment.

- Task diagram:
   Tasking allows us to divide a large task into small parts, which makes us more aware of the needs, but also makes our work more clear

- JavaScript basis:
  We focus on the ES6 feature especially some method of Array. Use filter as an example, we don't need writing a loop to go through all the element anymore. This will make our code look very simple and easy to understand, and the built-in function is definitely more efficient than the two-layer loop. Replacing a two-tier loop with built-in functions is a challenge, and you usually know how to optimize your code as you think about it.

- Java:
  The all-new Stream API introduced by Java 8 gives us a more efficient way to go through and manipulate the element of an array or list just as the filter/map method does in the JavaScript. This is a skill I have never used in my project, so I feel very excited because I can get new knowledge and do a lot of practice.
  
- TDD:
  It is a core practice and technology in agile development and a design methodology. The principle of TDD is to write unit test case code before the function code is developed. The test code determines what product code needs to be written. It teaches us to think about the requirements to use the task graph to decompose the requirements, rather than writing the code as soon as we see the requirements.

2. Problem / Confusing / Difficulties
   Some change needs to be done on my time management strategies. By the end of this week, I am tired and exhausted from delivering homework on time which gives me no time to Summarize what I've learned in a day. I need to balance my homework and summarizing knowledge with refactoring code.

3. Other Comments / Suggestion/Feeling 
   This week's training is actually very hard, but the harvest is really a lot. I actually feel that writing program is quite fun.

# [ITA] Daily Report on 2019/07/15

**1. Key learning, skills and experience acquired**

- Today we refactor the weekend homework. The refactoring is not easy, but we can focus on code smell like duplicate code, magic number, extra comment, long function body. That let me try to encapsulated object, extract methods and classes and Interface to make the code simple and clear.
- The afternoon we try use mockito to mock data which given by classes that we don't need to attention.

**2. Problem / Confusing / Difficulties**

- It is the first time for me to use mockito in java. But I think it was like to the mock.js in JS. I use the online document help me go through that process.
- It is hard to understand all needs. When there comes confuse, we should immediately ask others to clarify, Or all the work done is meaningless.

**3. Other Comments / Suggestion**

- We should only focus on the implementation functions covered in each test case, not the requirements we imagine.
